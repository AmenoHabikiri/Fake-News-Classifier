# Fake-News-Classifier
This is the project I am working on while learning the concepts of Machine Learning and Data Science.  Aim - The aim of the project is to build a fake news classifier using Natural Language Processing. We will take a dataset of labeled public-messages and apply classification techniques with frequency vectorizer like Tf-idf vectorizer and Count vectorizer. In NLP(Natural Language Processing) we face stop words which we will remove using Stemming Technique We can later test different model like Naive Bayes Model, Random Forest Model and K-NN (K-Nearest Neighbour) for accuracy and performance on unclassified public-messages using both Tf-idf vectorizer and count vectorizer.
